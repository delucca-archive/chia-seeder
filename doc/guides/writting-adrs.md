## When should I write an ADR

> An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures a decision, including the context of how the decision was made and the consequences of adopting the decision. At Spotify, a handful of teams use ADRs to document their decisions. One of these teams, The Creator Team, focuses on providing tools for creators to express themselves on Spotify, as well as access data about their content. The Creator Team utilizes ADRs to document decisions made related to system design and engineering best practices. We typically arrive at these decisions through discussion in Request for Comments (RFCs) or during our engineering meetings.

## The process of writing an ADR

### Step 1: Collect context regarding your decision

An architecture decision typically arrives during RFCs or engineering meetings. As soon as you identify that you're touching something that will impact other contributors, we suggest collecting context regarding your problems and organizing it as well as you can.

Keep in mind that your ADR will be stored and read by contributors without the same context that you currently have. So, nothing is "obvious". Try to explain as much as you can to keep your ADR context clear and easy to understand.

### Step 2: Duplicate the template

The first step to write your ADR is copying the [template file][adr-template]. That template aims to standardize our records, creating a standard structure to make discussion easier. The template is divided into the following sections:

* **Title:** The first line of the template contains the title of this ADR. You should name your document in a short statement that explains the solve problem and solution
* **Metadata:** Right below the title, we have some relevant metadata:
  * *Status:* The status defines what is the current state of this ADR. In the template, you have a couple of possible statuses you can define, but your ADR typically starts as `proposed.`
  * *Deciders:* This metadata contains a list of everyone involved in this decision
  * *Date:* The last updated date of this record
* **Context and Problem Statement:** In this section, you should give an overview of the problem and explain the context within this problem. Nothing is obvious, so don't spare any details
* **Decision Drivers:** This section is optional, but we highly encourage you to fill it out. You can list all the points that drove you to take this decision. A drive is a force or something that happened that triggered this decision
* **Considered Options:** In this section, you should list all the possible options that you considered in this decision
* **Decision Outcome:** Here, you should state which of the options you chose. Them, you may list all the positive and negative consequences of these decisions. Try to use the decision drivers you've defined while stating the pros and cons
* **Pros and Cons of the Options:** Like the previous section, in this section, you must use the decision drivers to state the pros and cons of each option. This will make it easier for others to understand what drove your decision
* **Links:** If you want to share any extra details, this section is where you can link to external resources

### Step 3: Write your ADR

Now, you should write your ADR. Don't forget to fill all sections, giving as many details as you can. This template is lightweight, but you should not spare details since this will fuel discussions regarding your decision.

### Step 4: Open a pull request

After writing your ADR, you should open a pull request. In that, you're going to discuss with other contributors regarding your ADR.

### Step 5: Discuss

You will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your pull request. This is a big part of the submission process, so don't be discouraged! Some contributors may sign off on the pull request right away; others may have more detailed comments or feedback. This is a necessary part of the process to evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.

During the discussion process, keep in mind that a human being is on the screen's other side. We have a [code of conduct][code-of-conduct] that everyone should follow.

### Step 6: Merge your pull request

The discussion ends typically when the majority of the contributors involved are comfortable with the decision. That decision could either **approve** or **reject** your ADR. In any of those cases, you should update your ADR metadata (`status`, `deciders`, and `date`) and merge your pull request.
