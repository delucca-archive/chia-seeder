# Code of Conduct

The Phant project has a [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct] that **all** contributors must follow. This code describes the **minimum** behavior expectations for all contributors.

As a contributor to Phant, how you choose to act and interact with your fellow contributors and the community will reflect not only on yourself but also on the project.  Our Code of Conduct intends, above all else, to help establish a culture within the project that allows anyone and everyone who wants to contribute to feel safe doing so.

If any individual acts in any way that violates the [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct], we will take corrective actions. However, it is possible for any individual to *act* in such a manner that is not in violation of the Code of Conduct guidelines' strict letter while still going entirely against the spirit of what that code intends to accomplish.

Open, diverse, and inclusive communities live and die based on trust. Contributors can disagree with one another so long as they trust that those disagreements are in good faith and everyone is working towards a common goal.

## Bad actors

All contributors to Phant tacitly agree to abide by both the letter and spirit of the [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. Failure, or unwillingness, to do so will result in the respectful decline of those contributions.

A *bad actor* is someone who repeatedly violates the spirit of the Code of Conduct through failure to regulate how they interact with others. In doing so, bad actors alienate other contributors, discourage collaboration, and generally reflect poorly on the project as a whole.

Being a bad actor may be intentional or unintentional. Typically, unintentional bad behavior can be easily corrected by being quick to apologize and correct course *even if you are not entirely convinced you need to*. Giving other contributors the benefit of the doubt and having a sincere willingness to admit that you *might* be wrong is critical for any successful open collaboration.

Don't be a bad actor.
